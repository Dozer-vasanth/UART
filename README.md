# UART
An implementation of UART using verilog


This UART consists of four parts:

Reciever.v - The part which recieves the Serial Signal
Transmitter.v - The part which transmits the Serial Signal
Baud_Rate_generator.v - The part that generates the specified Baud Rate of the communication
FIFO.v - A custom FIFO that can be used to Store all the data elements before transmitting or after recieving
UART.v - a small demostration connecting the RX and TX together
test_bench.v - The test bench that I designed to test my UART module
